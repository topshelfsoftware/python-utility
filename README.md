# python-utility

A collection of python utilities.

## Makefile

A `Makefile` is provided to standardize building and publishing the Python package. Satisfy the following prerequisites to be successful:

- Install Python 3.9 and add to PATH (executable name assumed to be `python3.9`)
- Create a file named `local_pypi_dir.txt` in the project root directory (same folder as this `README`)
  - Contents of file are a single line defining the path to a local directory to be used as a local PyPI repository

### Project Dependencies

Install project dependencies by running the following command one time

```bash
# install project deps such as poetry
make install
```

### Build Instructions

Simply navigate to the same folder as this `README`, and run the following command to build and publish the utility package to a local PyPI repo.

```bash
make
```

This command activates the virtual environment with `poetry`, builds the package as a wheel and copies it the local PyPI repository.

## Versioning

This package uses Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 to describe MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH releases.

IMPORTANT‚ùó
Search the project for the existing package version and update in the following places prior to building the package and deploying the lambda layer:

- `PKG_VER` variable in the project `Makefile`
- `version` in the poetry `pyproject.toml`
- `PackageVersion` parameter in the `samconfig.toml`
- `topshelfsoftware-util` package in the `lambda_layer/no_deps/requirements.txt`

## Tagging

After incrementing the package version (and merging PR), create an associated tag of the repository. Perform the following from the command line:

```bash
git tag -a <version> <commit_hash>
```

`<version>` will take the form vX.Y.Z where X.Y.Z represents MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH in semantic versioning. Then push the tag to the remote server using:

```bash
git push origin <version>
```
